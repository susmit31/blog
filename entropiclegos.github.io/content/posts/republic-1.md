##  # What is the _Republic_?
Plato's _Republic_ is one of the most renowned pieces of Greek philosophy and remains to be one of the most instructive ones of the Socratic dialogues. It delves into the what _justice_ means, in the precise sense. It is comprised of 10 chapters, called "books" by Plato. In this post I will try delivering the essence of what goes down in _Book 1_ of the _Republic_.

### What's it about?
Book 1 serves as a setup chapter for what is to come. It starts exploring the concept of justice through a dialogue, most notably, with Thrasymachus, a sophist. Other characters also play a supportive role.
