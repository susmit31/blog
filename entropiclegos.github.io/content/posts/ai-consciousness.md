## TL;DR
1. Consciousness vs intelligence
2. Awareness as consciousness
3. Consciousness vs free will
4. Thought experiments: take away certain aspects from humans who will definitely be considered to be conscious to arrive at edge cases that people are still likely to rate as conscious, and then demonstrate equivalence with an artificial case
	a. Human with no memory - conscious?
	b. Human who has no persistent "on" state and only responds to very specifically formed stimuli - conscious? (very similar to current chatGPT Grok etc)
	c. Human in a coma?
5. AI as "professional smart people" and rendering human intellect obsolete, humans having to resort to menial tasks AI *won't* do
