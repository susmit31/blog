## TL;DR
In a post several months back, I discussed how the traditional straight-line supply and demand models are limited in their scope. On the basis of symmetry considerations between money and goods, I came up with "chart transition maps", so to speak, for going back and forth between a money-space representation of transactions and a goods-space representation. The classical supply-curve thus transformed into a money-space demand curve was a dud, leading me to rejecting the status quo. The *transactional invariance transformations* coupled with judiciously considered applications of what I call the *principle of transactional symmetry* plus other reasonable assumptions about supply-and-demand behaviour yield different classes of mathematically plausible supply-demand scenarios corresponding to different physical situations. In this post I discuss a few examples of working from the ground up to come up with a few such solution classes.
